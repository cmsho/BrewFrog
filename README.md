# BrewFrog
BrewFrog is a Python web application that I created for the course "Developing User Interfaces" at Drexel University in 2020.  BrewFrog allows users to view a catalogue of beers, filter through the catalogue, and add selected beers to their favorites page if they are logged in.  The site utilizes an SQLite3 database with tables for users and beers.  The site includes simple, secure user authentication.

# Project Dependencies
This project requires Python3, Flask, passlib, and WTForms.
* To install Python3, visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* To install Flask, navigate to this project directory and run 'pip install Flask' on the command line.
* To install passlib, navigate to this project directory and run 'pip install passlib' on the command line.
* To install WTForms, navigate to this project directory and run 'pip install WTForms' on the command line.

# Deployment
* To run the program run 'python run.py' on the command line from the BrewFrog directory.  This will initialize the Flask server.
* Once the Flask server is running, open a web browser and navigate to "localhost:8080" to view the BrewFrog site.

# Additional Remarks
A research report that I wrote to accompany the project can be found in the 'docs' folder.
